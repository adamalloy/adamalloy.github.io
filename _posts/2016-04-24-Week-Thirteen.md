What Did I Do This Week?

We finished the project! I am very happy about how our website turned out. It looks great, routes all the data, and other than one page it
works exactly as we planned it. It is so cool to have been a part of a team that produced a working product. I can't wait to do this in 
the workplace. This last week I wrote most of the tests for the test server and refined the API, as well as doing backend routing.

What Got In The Way?
We never resolved the circular dependency that prevented the neighborhood data from populating.  Me and Stephen
had another major group project in Data Management we've been working on so this has been a huge time crunch.
I also feel like groups of 5 are too big for the scope of this project, and that with a group of four the work would have
been more evenly distributed.

What Will I Do Next Week?
We have a first day presentation and me and Stephen have our data management presentation the same day. So I have a lot of work to do.
I also need to begin studying for the final to ensure I do well.

Tip Of The Week:
When you know your teammates better and comfortable enough with them to be yourself then work becomes a lot more enjoyable.
