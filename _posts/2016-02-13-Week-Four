This week I got a peak at the kind of project that I took this class to conquer. We have BIG amounts of data from a major company and we're going
to use it to make their service better... if we do the job right. There's sharp competition for a million dollar prize and somehow I doubt
I'll be walking to the bank with the money. I would love more meta data about the movies to work with, if I could recommend some classic
70's films to someone who's a fan of Quentin Taratino my algorithm would be a solid competitor. So far the hardest part about the assignment
is figuring out exactly what we are supposed to do. I have good chemistry with my partner, who I met online, and am looking forward to our
beautiful future... coding in the basement lab with Chik-fil-a breaks.

Our talk with Ben Porter was illuminating. He talked about how his workplace breaks apart a project and the way it schedules improvements like
upgrading a vehicle, instead of only focusing on the final version. This completely goes against Dijkstra's approach to coding - where
the code you write should be the final version of a symphony. I think Porter's approach is more realistic, especially for the workplace.
He also said one reason he moved to his current job is he loved working with his product manager, someday I hope I have a team that
feels the same way about me. 

As with every week, my schedule is my biggest obstacle. Monday to Wednesday were so packed that I couldn't start the project until Thursday.
This weekend was dominated by coding - but we called it a day early when we had an algorithm that was close to the project requirements.
I am hoping we will talk about possible optimizations tomorrow. I am very proud of my first 7 on a quiz this year and know it is the first of many.

Protip: find people you like working with and work flies by.
