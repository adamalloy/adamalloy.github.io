What Could Be Done To Improve The Test?

My major difficulty with this test was encountering unfamiliar parameter entry in some of the functions. I will not go into detail about what
I mean by this, because some of the students have not taken the test, but that was the only thing about the test that was unfamiliar
and the fact that it was in so many questions really threw me off. Everything else was expected and I found it to be fairly straightforward.

What We Did Do This Past Week?

I really like the readings that we have to do, even if they are more applicable to C++ than python it is interesting to have these principles
explicitly spelled out. It's also valuable to need to study for a test, reviewing material for an examination makes you learn more.
I know that it made my python code stronger to type out many of the exercises we went over in class. I tried to form a study group
and talked to other students in class but no one came, so I made my own practice test. 

What Is In Your Way?
Hopefully not my score on the midterm. Although I was able to code good answers for a lot of the questions and give sufficient short answers
the afformentioned issue with parameters definitely effected my grade, also I am not positive my solutions for the last questions are
sufficient. Even if I failed the test dropping is not an option, as an out of state student I simply cannot afford to pay for this course
again. I don't really know what to do to perform better, as I study, prepare for class, do all the readings, perform well on projects, etc.
Punctuality with regards to deadlines is something I definitely need to improve.

What Will I Do Next Week?
A midterm and a major project, two interviews. It's good that the job search is starting to pay off. In this class I will start working on the
the project.

Tip Of The Week: Do your blog before Sunday.
