What Did I Do This Week?

This last week I dedicated to studying for the final. That involved writing a lot of code, ensuring that I was familiar with all the different
refactoring techniques, going over almost all of the lectures for the year, and making sure I understood all the different data delivery
schemas. It is always a good excerise to review for a final - it ensures that I have a good grasp of the material. I felt confident going
into the test and have been having a good time relaxing now that it's done. 

What Got In The Way?

I didn't feel like I had enough pracitce refactoring code to excel on the last refactoring question on the test. It was one thing to read
about the strategies, but without implementing them that question was very challenging. I coudln't remember exactly how to handle that
particular case, I was happy when I figured out that Movie2 was not an implementation of Price though. I also am not sure if I handled
the decorator correctly. Overall the test was managable and engaging.

What Am I Going To Do Next Week?

I am going to continue to look for a job. I think that my ideal role in a tech company would be technical sales or project management. 
Based on my experiences in this class I do not think that software engineering is the correct job for me. This is a good thing to learn
now. I am going to study for my last final - but also take the time to work out and spend time in nature that I have not had for the last
few months.

Tip Of The Week:
Enjoy your summer, it may be your last.
