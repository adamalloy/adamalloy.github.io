title: First Week

I am excited to be learn Software Engineering. Out of all of the classes I've taken in my time in CS, 373 seems like the one I'll get the most out of.
In the first lecture Professor Downing told us we'd have designed a running website with a built in database by the end of the semester, which is a project
I am heavily anticipating. 

What Did I Do In The First Week?

Though I have learned the basics of Python online it seems like this class will provide a more in depth examination of this dynamic language. In the first week
we went over syntax and some applications. I bought my textbooks and began to read Extreme Programming. Professor Downing randomly calls on students to answer
questions in class - I was the first person to be called on in lecture, which is something I am used to with the my first and last name starting with A.

I also set up my GitHub education account so I could begin working on the Collatz project next week. 

What's In My way?

This blog took me a very long time to set up. I had tried to set it up with command line arguments before I found a pre-set repo we could fork to make blogging easy.

The quizzes seem like they will be a big issue for me. I am confident in my abilities to exceed on projects and tests but quick quizzes have never been my forte.

This class is coding and reading intensive, so I need to be very proactive in order to suceed.

What Am I Going To Do Next Week?

Next week it's time to get my fingers flexing on the Collatz project. The project seems fun and not too challenging, I think the main point of it is to familiarize us
with using git regularly, and with the continuous integration technology Travis we will be using to track our progress. I have a lot of reading to do as well.
