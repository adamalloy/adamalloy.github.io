What Did I Do This Week?

I figured out who my teammates are going to be for the idb project. They are Keith Gibson, Stephen Perl, Steven Zhu, and Brian Quimio. This
is exciting because most of my group are friends in CS and I think the team will have a good dynamic. We had a speaker from Rackspace
come talk to us about some of the technology we'll be using on the project. 

What Got In The Way?
We didn't get as much of the footwork done on the project as we could have. There weren't a lot of ideas being throw around about
possible APIs so I think we settled on one which is fairly unexciting. Also Spring Break is happening and I have friends visiting from
California and an interview project I need to finish, so it will be hard to find time to work on the project.

What Will I Do Next Week?
I have a coding project to do which is essentially reads a stock ticker and adds asks and bids to an orderbook. I am the project seems
like a good challenge and is in Java, which I haven't worked in since 314. I have two very good friends visiting from California 
and am hoping to show them what makes Austin so special.

Tip Of The Week:
Landing a job interview is often more about who you know and how you can network than what skills you have.
