This Week:

This week all my deadlines converged. Collatz was due, along with the career fair and an unexpected interview, topped off with two 
homeworks in my other classes! Luckily I was prepared to code late into the night in the lab and everything went off without a hitch.
I was very proud of my Collatz cache implementation. I used a 5 granularities with various intervals and a recursive function to get lightning fast results
with small file size. I could have further optimized it with a 6th granularity and a lazy cache and am tempted to so I can pass
Sphere. 

We learned about some sweet details about how python operates: since tuples are immutable if we add another value to one another tuple
is created. Python is more enjoyable to code in than C and I am excited to sharpen this tool in my belt.

Issues:
I had a technical issue with the quiz. It prompted me for the attendence code and never loaded. By the time I pulled it up in
another browser it had timed out. I knew the answers to the questions and it would have been my highest scored quiz.

I also wasn't running the proper version of python on Sphere. I had been running it on python 3 (which said it would run 3.4) and getting 
a wrong answer error. When I ran it on python 3.4 I got a timeout error. I know if I had found out I was running the wrong version
earlier I could have optimized it to pass.

Next Week:
Am looking forward to relaxing, to be honest. Catching up on backreading and getting started on the netflix project will be
top priorities.
