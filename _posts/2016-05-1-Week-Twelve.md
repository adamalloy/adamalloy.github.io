What Did I Do This Week?

This week Team BASK presented our website to the class. It was fantastic to culminate our six week project and have a working site.
During the presentation caching made it look like our search wasn't working, but it does work. I also made my portfolio, putting in a
memory allocation program from Operating Systems and an interview project I worked heavily on over spring break. Seelio seems like an
interesting website, I am going to see if I can use it on my job search.


What Got In The Way?

The number one issue that got in our way was the caching of an old version of the website that made it look like our search didn't work.
Technical issues can cause serious problems in a public presentation. I hosted a show on Friday where technical issues caused delays
and sound quality issues. It's important to check the full functionality of something before you show it off publically.

What Will I Do Next Week?
Study, study, study. The big test is on Thursday and I want to do well on it. My plan is to write a lot of python code and read
as much of refactoring as I can.

Tip Of The Week:
Make sure you have your python down solidly for the test and try to imagine some curve ball inputs that might be thrown.
