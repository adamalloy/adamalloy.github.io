This week we’ve been learning about classes in python, something I haven’t done much with since 314 almost two years ago. The syntax of python is getting on my nerves, the implicit declarative nature without static typing is a feature I originally loved but sometimes I just want to declare what I am working with. I frequently do not double check things like brackets or if an object is being generated, so I miss questions on quizzes. At least this is an issue I am aware of so I can work to fix it. 

The two tech talks have been very useful. I realized my main stumbling block in getting an internship has been a lack of projects so I have started working on a website with Django, coding the backend in python and the front in javascript. It will essentially be a student art gallery and shop, with features to be added on coming iterations a la the techniques described by Ben Porter. Thanks to Conrad’s talk about using open source technologies I have been exploring my various options to make the development process smoother.  I don’t know where the time will come from for the project, or where other people find the time to build up their portfolios, I am in the lab until 3-4 am every night, work on weekends and have been applying for 2-3 jobs a day for a month without success. I will have to make time because it will pay off dividends. 

This week I have a major homework due in Data Management and the midterm in CS 373 on Thursday. Unfortunately I haven’t been able to study as much as I want to, but on Tuesday I will have free time and will go through all of the quizzes to make sure I understand how they work. I need to keep applying to jobs and make my linkedin work for me. I am also planning on going to tech meetups the first week of March so I can network in person.
