What Did I Do This Week?

This week we lauched a version of our website which was able to load some of our pages dynamically from our database. I worked on the
backend, figuring out how to route json data from trulia to our front end. I also refined our API and did a lot of the technical writeup.
A significant chunk of my work went into a campsite API which due to time constraints was unfortunately discarded. This was rather disappointing,
as I was excited to see additional functionality added to our website. Ultimately this decision to abandon the additional datasource
was the right one to make, as we were unable to get all of our original pages routed correctly and there was no way we could have done
a fourth page. 

What Got In The Way? 
We tried to do too much by adding in the additional campsite data. I could have been more useful on other portions of the project.
In our backend there was a circular dependency in our neighborhoods page which prevented us from getting to route correctly.
It was also rather difficult to determine the inner state of our database for much of the last few days. 

What Will I Do Next Week?
Next week we will get our website up to speed and add additional functionality. I will be working on routing and on several other projects.
The semester is winding down and there is a lot of work yet to be done.

Tip of the Week: 
Don't bite off more than you can chew.
