What Did I Do This Week?

I worked on integrating new API data into our website and data model. This information will allow users to see which state parks are in 
the state they are moving to. It will also allow them to use the longitude and latitude of their city to determine parks in the surrounding
area. This data will make Virtual Address Space more well rounded. I have written scripts to extract the data from the API to build our database,
the Active API only allows two calls per minute so we need to extract and store the data to use it. Two speakers from Atlassian came by to talk
to us about their products and how their office executes workflows for developing features.

What Was In My Way?
Figuring out how to write the scripts to extract the data has been problematic. My quiz scores are still consistently low. I also have had many
commitments this week that have gotten in the way of school. For the most part there have not been any major challenges for me this week. 

What Will I Do Next Week?

It's time to finish round two of the project! By the end of the week my team will have developed a backend database and populated it with
all the information we need to run Virtual Address Space. I have to work on the API and write a very more python files, and also update the wiki.

Tip Of The Week:
Make time for balance and personal happiness, keep track of your goals and work on them every day. Do not allow yourself to be overrun by deadlines.
