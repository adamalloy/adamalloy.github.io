What Did I Do This Week?

This week we began phase three of the idb project. I've been working on the API side - both ensuring our meets our final specs and mapping out
how we will integrate the other team's API. Fortunately Stealth Mode's API really meshes with the concept of our website. One of the original ideas we decided not to presue would have provided users with data about the startups in their cities. Our site was
 intended to provide valuable housing information to new hires in the tech industry. Stealth Mode's API provides information
about startups and cities they were founded in. We will easily be able to integerate this data into our website in a meaningful way. 
I am also happy to report that I have been scoring consistently higher on quizzes - which has been a major sticking point for me this semester.

What Got In My Way?

In every phase of this project we have been behind schedule. This lag is still causing our team be behind several other groups. Although
we have made our schedule in such a way that provides us with three days of wiggle room before Thursday I think it is likely we will use a couple of them.
I have a tremendous amount on my plate other than the project, and though it is all manageable I expect to get little sleep in the upcoming week.

What Will I Do Next Week?

Next week we will finish the project and I will have time to catch up with the refactoring book. We will finish implementing Stealth Mode's API
and also will have working search. This project has been a valuable learning experience and I expect to be proud of the finished product.

Tip Of The Week
Helping other people who are struggling with writing code is an awesome way to get better yourself.
