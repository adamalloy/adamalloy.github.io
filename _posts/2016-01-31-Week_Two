This Week:
My primary work this week focused on setup for the Collatz project. That means getting familiar with using Github. I'd used github 
a few times in Operating Systems and System Architecture but did not know how to manage one with command line arguments. This week
I learned how to clone files from github onto my remote machine and how to get these files back on github after I edited them. This
is an invaluable skill to have for the professional world or if I want to work on a project on multiple machines. I have begun
to think about how I am going to optimize my solution to Collatz. It is very cool to approach a project in a test oriented way, as
in having some tests that we are gearing the project to answering. This is a different way to look at designing code. Making
sure I have the acceptance tests to guide me, when I optimize code later I'll immediately know if it breaks

Issues: 
The readings were very intensive, I read some of the book but not far enough into it to get questions related to the reading right on
in class quizzes. These quizzes, for some reason, are difficult for me to succeed on. A lot of it has to do with the short time frame,
logging into the canvas and input the code takes almost 30 seconds of quiz time. I only have 12 issues on the git tracker, but am
saving the rest of them for bugs that may arrise during the project.

Next Week:
Next week will be crazy - the career fair, two homeworks in other classes, and then Collatz is due. I need to work hard over the weekend
and pace myself. I am confident that everything will work out. I polished off my resume by adding a comprehensive list of projects I've worked on.

Tip Of The Week:
Get ahead! When you know that there will be a time crunch in the future make plans to take stress off of yourself and excute them!
